Tablet based novel word learning task 


This task is intended to introduce participants to a human informant that matches them on gender and race social dimensions and a human informant that matches them only on race. These informants are equally knowledgeable on objects familiar to participants (ie apple, ball, etc.) and as such provide the same correct label for these objects. The manipulation is that the ingroup and outgroup informants provide conflicting labels for novel objects that are prototypically masculine or feminine colors. The goal of this task is to see what label participants believe is correct for each novel object. This will hopefully provide insight into who the participants believe is the more knowledgeable/more trustworthy informant, as well as who they retain information from.
